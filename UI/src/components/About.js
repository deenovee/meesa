      <p>
        I'm currently studying electrical engineering at Auburn University and have a strong passion for all things tech. 
        Iâ€™m skilled in Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Linux, Docker, MongoDB, virtual machines, and Bash. 
        I love working with machine learning models, tinkering with Raspberry Pis, and diving into pentesting and ethical hacking. 
        Automation is my thing, finding ways to make tech work smarter and more efficiently is what I enjoy most.
